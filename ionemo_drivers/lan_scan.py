    """Fast host-presence pre-filter for quick=True scans.

    Nudges ARP resolution for every candidate address -- a UDP connect()
    sends no data, but makes the OS resolve the route (and, for a
    same-subnet address, the ARP entry) as a side effect, the same
    technique already used a few lines up for local_ip detection, and in
    the main app's src/setup/network.py get_gateway_mac() (which cites this
    exact function's local_ip trick as precedent). This generalizes it from
    one address (the gateway) to the whole candidate range.

    Timing behaviour, as last spiked against a real deployment: real hosts on
    the LAN resolved within ~10ms of the nudge, well inside the 0.4s default
    wait_s; zero false positives on genuinely unused addresses waited out to
    2s -- re-verify this if wait_s is ever tuned down. Real devices normally
    already have a warm ARP entry from ambient traffic (routers/phones/etc.
    talk on their own); the nudge exists for
    the cold case -- a device with no recent traffic -- which is exactly
    what src/setup/network.py's own comment already relies on ("nudge the
    ARP entry to populate if this is the very first lookup since boot").

    Returns None -- not an empty set -- if /proc/net/arp can't be read at
    all (e.g. a non-Linux dev environment). Callers MUST treat that as
    "couldn't determine, don't filter", never as "nothing is alive": an
    empty set would silently turn a quick scan into "always finds nothing"
    on any host where this file doesn't exist, rather than falling back to
    scanning every address. Linux-only, matching this project's only
    supported deployment target (same as the main app's get_gateway_mac).

# their own identical ARP pre-filter over the same 254 addresses. That is pure
# duplicate work: which addresses are alive has nothing to do with which driver is
# asking. With four builtin drivers it was survivable; the cost is linear in driver
# count, and this package is designed for third-party drivers to be added.
#
# The TTL only has to outlive the moment every driver starts scanning, not a whole
# scan: run_discovery() submits them together and the sweep itself takes about
# quick_wait_s. A few seconds covers thread-start jitter with room to spare.
#
# Kept deliberately short because the failure mode of a long TTL is worse than a
# duplicated sweep: someone plugs a device in, presses scan again, and gets answered
# from a set collected before it was on the network. Five seconds is far below any
# human retry loop, so a rescan a person actually initiates always re-checks.
