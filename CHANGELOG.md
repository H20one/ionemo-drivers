# Changelog

All notable changes to the device drivers package are documented here.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-09-05

### Changed
- Quick discovery now performs **one** live-host sweep shared by every driver scanning at the same
  time, instead of one sweep per driver. The host app launches every registered driver
  concurrently and each swept the same /24 to work out which addresses are alive — but that
  answer does not depend on which driver is asking. With four builtin drivers this was survivable;
  the cost was linear in driver count, in a package built for third parties to add drivers to. No
  driver contract change, and no driver needs updating.
- The shared result is held for five seconds — long enough to cover every driver starting, short
  enough that a scan a person actually initiates always re-checks the network. A longer window
  would risk answering “I just plugged it in, scan again” from a sweep taken before the device
  was connected.
- Deep scan is unchanged. It exists to cover the pre-filter missing a live device, and this change
  makes quick scanning cheaper without making deep any less necessary.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-09-05

### Fixed — SECURITY TOOLING
- **`test_security_compliance.py` was not scanning any driver.** While this package lived at
  `drivers/` inside the application repo, its file glob was anchored on the package directory and
  correctly reached `drivers/grid/*.py`. Extracting the package into this repo shifted the same
  expression up one level, so it matched `ionemo_drivers/*.py` and nothing deeper — from the
  extraction until now it covered the shared infrastructure (`base.py`, `cert_store.py`,
  `registry.py`, `lan_scan.py`, `contract_validation.py`) and **not one actual driver**. Nothing
  ever failed, because scanning five clean files passes. Confirmed by planting `import subprocess`
  in `homewizard_p1.py`: the suite stayed green. The scan is now anchored on the package and
  recurses, so all four drivers are covered — and all four pass every existing rule, so this
  restores a blind gate rather than fixing bad driver code. Three new tests assert the scan
  reaches every driver by name, so it cannot go quiet again.

### Added
- `tools/harness.py` — a reference test harness for driver developers. Runs a driver the way the
  host application does (discovery, config schema, construction, polled reads) without needing the
  application, which is not public. Validates each reading against the published data contract and
  flags reads that exceed the app's timeout budget. Stdlib only. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-04

### Changed — BREAKING
- Package renamed from `energy_optimizer_drivers` to `ionemo_drivers`, matching the product's actual
  brand name (Ionemo) rather than the original repo's working title. **Every import site changes**:
  `from energy_optimizer_drivers.pv.aurora_rs485 import AuroraRS485Driver` becomes
  `from ionemo_drivers.pv.aurora_rs485 import AuroraRS485Driver`, and so on for every module. The
  PyPI/dist name changes too: `energy-optimizer-device-drivers` -> `ionemo-drivers` (update both the
  `git+https://...` URL and its `#egg=` fragment in any pin).
- The third-party plugin entry-point group also renamed: `energy_optimizer.drivers` ->
  `ionemo.drivers`. This is normally treated as a stability guarantee (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s
  "Changes that need a maintainer" section, `TestEntryPointGroupName`) — renamed anyway, deliberately,
  because no external driver package exists yet to break; this is the last moment the rename is free.
  Anyone building an external driver package must update their `pyproject.toml`'s
  `[project.entry-points."..."]` group name to match.
- No behavior change to any driver's actual logic — this is a pure rename, verified by the full
  existing test suite (371 tests) passing unchanged, plus a real `pip install .` + registry
  load-and-discover smoke test post-rename.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-04

### Added
- `aurora_rs485.py`'s `discover()` now scans a small set of common serial ports
  (`/dev/ttyUSB0`-`/dev/ttyUSB3`, then `/dev/ttyACM0`) instead of only the default
  `/dev/ttyUSB0`, stopping at the first candidate that yields an inverter. Combined with the host
  app's now-generic device passthrough (0.3.0/0.3.1), this makes RS-485 setup genuinely plug-and-play
  for the common cases it previously missed: a second/third adapter present, or a chipset that
  enumerates under `ttyACM` instead of `ttyUSB`. A candidate that doesn't exist fails instantly
  (no per-baud-rate wait), so the extra scanning costs virtually nothing when only one real adapter
  is attached. `_open_serial()`'s signature and return contract changed (`port` param added; a
  missing path now returns `None` instead of a `DiscoveryResult`, so callers can silently try the
  next candidate) -- internal to this driver, no config_schema()/contract change.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Docs-only follow-up to 0.3.0: the host app's `docker-compose.yml` now grants its container
  generic, identical access to any USB-serial device (a `/dev` bind-mount plus `device_cgroup_rules`
  scoped to the `ttyUSB`/`ttyACM` device classes) instead of a per-installation
  `docker-compose.override.yml` device mapping -- that per-installation file no longer exists.
  Updated `aurora_rs485.py`'s docstring/setup guide/config hint text and
  `docs/drivers/aurora_rs485.md` to describe the new reality: nothing to configure at the container
  level, ever, on any installation. No functional/API change.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-04

### Changed
- `aurora_rs485.py` no longer hardcodes its serial port. Found during a hygiene sweep:
  `_PORT = "/dev/ttyUSB1"` was a fact about one specific deployment's Docker device-mapping choice
  (a `docker-compose.override.yml` remap in the main app repo), not a fact about the inverter model
  — a different deployment with a plain passthrough would silently get a wrong, hardcoded path and
  no way to fix it short of forking the driver. `port` is now an optional `config_schema()` field,
  same as `address`/`baudrate`, defaulting to `/dev/ttyUSB0` (the common single-adapter case).
  `discover()` now reports the port it actually used in each found device's config, same as it
  already does for `baudrate`.

  **Migration note:** the default changed from `/dev/ttyUSB1` to `/dev/ttyUSB0` — if an existing
  deployment relied on the old hardcoded value (e.g. via a `docker-compose.override.yml` device
  remap to make the container-internal path match), update that remap to a plain
  `/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0` passthrough matching the new default, or set the device's `port`
  config explicitly if your setup genuinely needs something else. `docs/drivers/aurora_rs485.md` now
  recommends the plain passthrough as the default for any deployment (a base station shouldn't need
  device-specific host configuration, like a udev rule matching one particular adapter's chip ID,
  just to work) -- a custom udev symlink is now documented as an optional, per-installation choice
  for someone with more than one USB-serial adapter, not something to bake into a shared image.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- Documentation drift caught after shipping `discover_quick()` in 0.2.1: `docs/contracts/*.md` (all
  four device types), `SECURITY.md`, and `.github/agents/driver-reviewer.agent.md`'s own review
  checklist all still said discovery "must not block for more than 30 seconds" — stale since
  `scan_subnet()`'s `scan_timeout` changed twice earlier the same day (45s, then 60s) without any of
  these catching up. Reworded to reference `scan_subnet()`'s own docstring as the authoritative
  current number instead of repeating a figure that's already drifted once and could again.
- `discover_quick()` itself was undocumented outside of `base.py`'s own docstring — added to all
  four `docs/contracts/*.md` files, `README.md`'s "optional overrides" list, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s
  driver-writing guide, so an outside contributor writing a new LAN-based driver can actually find
  this extension point.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- 0.2.0's design for exposing `scan_subnet()`'s new `quick` parameter through a driver's `discover()`
  was never actually consumed by any caller, and would have broken `test_contract_compliance.py`'s
  existing, deliberate `discover()` "takes no arguments" check the moment it was. Replaced with a
  separate, optional `discover_quick()` classmethod instead: `discover()` itself is completely
  unchanged (still zero-argument, contract intact), and `BaseDriver.discover_quick()`'s default
  implementation just calls `discover()` unmodified, so any driver — including third-party ones —
  that doesn't override it keeps working exactly as before, with no risk of breaking on an
  unexpected keyword argument. `homewizard_p1` and `daikin_brp` override `discover_quick()` to
  forward `quick=True` into their own `scan_subnet()` call; `aurora_rs485` and `alfen_eve` (nothing
  to ARP-pre-filter) don't override it and are unaffected.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-04

### Added
- `scan_subnet()` gains an opt-in `quick: bool = False` parameter. When `True`, a fast host-presence
  pre-filter runs before the slow per-address HTTP probe: every candidate address gets a UDP
  `connect()` (sends no data, only nudges ARP resolution as a side effect — the same technique
  already used for local-subnet detection in this module and for the main app's gateway-MAC lookup),
  then `/proc/net/arp` is read once to see which addresses actually have a live host. Only those
  addresses get the full probe; a genuinely unused address (most of a home `/24`) is skipped
  entirely instead of paying its ~2.5s per-probe timeout. Confirmed live against a real deployment:
  full-subnet host discovery in well under 100ms, zero false negatives against real devices, zero
  false positives against genuinely unused addresses. Falls back to scanning every address if the
  pre-filter can't determine anything (`/proc/net/arp` unreadable) — never silently "finds nothing"
  instead. Default `False` preserves the exhaustive behavior every existing caller already gets,
  unchanged.

## 0.1.15 — 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Network discovery's overall scan timeout (`scan_subnet`) is now 60s (was 45s, set only hours
  earlier) — 45s left just ~3s of margin above the documented worst-case sweep time (~42s), which
  was judged too tight. This is a ceiling, not a target: the scan already returns as soon as it
  finishes sweeping every address, however much sooner than the timeout that is — this only raises
  how long a scan is allowed to run before giving up on genuinely slow-to-resolve addresses.

## 0.1.14 — 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- Network discovery (HomeWizard P1, Daikin BRP) could silently fail to find a real, reachable
  device if its IP address happened to fall late in the scanned range (roughly the top two-thirds
  of a typical home `/24`). A non-responding address doesn't fail fast — no ARP reply means the
  connection attempt hangs for the full per-probe timeout (~2.5s) rather than an instant refusal —
  so scanning the full 253-address range at 15 concurrent connections needs up to ~42s in the
  worst case, but the scan only ever waited 15s before giving up. Confirmed live against a real
  deployment: reachable devices were reported as "not found" simply because the scan never got to
  their address before quitting. The scan now waits long enough to actually finish sweeping the
  whole subnet.

## 0.1.13 — 2026-09-01

### Changed
- Rebranded from "Energy Optimizer" to **Ionemo** everywhere it appeared: `README.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `pyproject.toml`'s description, the package's own
  `__init__.py` docstring, and every built-in driver's setup guide / discovery-warning text
  (`homewizard_p1.py`, `aurora_rs485.py`, `alfen_eve.py`, `daikin_brp.py`) and matching
  `docs/contracts/*.md` / `docs/drivers/*.md` examples — these strings are user-facing (shown in
  the Add Device wizard), not just internal docs. Warnings about the physical device/hardware now
  say "Ionemo base" and warnings about the software say "Ionemo", per the naming convention decided
  alongside the rebrand (see `energy-optimizer`'s `docs/IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md` N33).

## 0.1.12 — 2026-08-29

### Added
- `basedpyright` now actually runs in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — previously it was only a
  checklist item in `CONTRIBUTING.md` ("reports 0 errors"), unenforced and easy to skip.
- `requirements-dev.txt` — this repo had no shared, versioned dev-tooling file at all; CI installed
  `pytest`/`pytest-cov`/`ruff` as loose unpinned lines directly in the workflow YAML, with nothing a
  contributor could install from to reliably match CI locally. Now `pip install -r
  requirements-dev.txt` gets the exact same `ruff`/`basedpyright`/`pytest` versions CI uses, and
  `pyrightconfig.json` (already committed) applies automatically once `basedpyright` is installed —
  same config, not just the same tool name.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s Prerequisites section now gives the install command explicitly; the
  `basedpyright` checklist item now says CI enforces it instead of implying it's honor-system.
- `SECURITY.md`'s "Enforcement" section now lists `basedpyright` among what CI actually runs.

## 0.1.11 — 2026-08-29

### Changed
- `cert_store.resolve_verify()`/`_pinned_path()` take a new `prefix` parameter (defaulting to
  `"device"`) instead of hardcoding `"alfen_"` — this module is shared TOFU-pinning infrastructure
  for any HTTPS driver, not Alfen-specific, and the pinned filename should say which driver a cert
  belongs to. `alfen_eve.py` now passes its own `driver_id`. Not a collision fix (the IP already
  makes filenames unique) — a clarity fix, since a future second HTTPS driver's pinned certs would
  otherwise be filed under a misleading `alfen_*` name.
- Added `tests/test_cert_store.py` — this module had no dedicated tests at all before now.

**Operational note**: any already-deployed Alfen charger's pinned cert (`data/certs/alfen_<ip>.pem`)
won't match the new expected filename (`alfen_eve_<ip>.pem`) and will be silently re-pinned via TOFU
on the next connection — automatic, harmless, but a real filesystem change worth knowing about
before this version reaches a live install.

## 0.1.10 — 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- `validate_contract_data()` typed its `data` parameter as `dict[str, Any]`, but a
  `GridMeterData`/etc. TypedDict is not statically assignable to `dict[str, Any]` (TypedDicts
  aren't subtypes of `dict` under static type checking, due to mutability/invariance) — every
  call site passing a driver's real `get_data()` result was a type error. Changed to
  `Mapping[str, Any]`, which a TypedDict does satisfy. Also fixed several test-file call sites
  that indexed an optional TypedDict field directly (`data["gas_total_m3"]`) instead of `.get(...)`
  — valid at runtime here since this repo's convention always sets optional fields to `None`
  rather than omitting them, but not something a type checker can know, so it flagged them as
  potentially-absent-key accesses.
- Added `pyrightconfig.json` (`typeCheckingMode: "standard"`, matching `energy-optimizer`'s own) —
  `basedpyright` previously had no config here and ran under its much stricter default preset,
  which is not what `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "0 errors" checklist item was ever measured against. Under
  standard mode this repo is genuinely 0 errors/0 warnings.

## 0.1.9 — 2026-08-29

### Added
- `tests/test_public_api_stability.py` — freezes the exact things
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Changes that need a maintainer" section warns about (ABC method signatures,
  `DRIVER_CALL_TIMEOUT`, the `energy_optimizer.drivers` entry-point group name) so a change to any of
  them fails this repo's own CI immediately, intentional or not, instead of only being caught by
  someone reading the doc. Deliberately narrow — it does not and cannot catch every way a change here
  could break the main app (that would mean running that private repo's test suite against this
  code, which isn't set up); see the file's docstring for the exact boundary.

### Changed
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Why a separate repo" section no longer frames the design as a choice between
  two options — it explains the implemented in-process-package approach directly. The rejected
  network-service alternative added length without changing anything about how this repo actually
  works.
- Each item in "Changes that need a maintainer" now says explicitly whether it's checked by
  `test_public_api_stability.py` or not (and why, for the two that aren't) — previously the section
  asserted these were breaking changes without saying whether anything actually verified that.
- Moved the RS-485 USB passthrough note into "What this repo deliberately does not do" (as a concrete
  example under the existing "no deployment" point) and named the specific driver it explains
  (`aurora_rs485.py`'s fixed `/dev/ttyUSB1` path) — previously it sat disconnected from any driver
  under "How the main app consumes this package," without saying which driver it was about.

## 0.1.8 — 2026-08-29

### Added
- `tests/test_homewizard_p1.py` — the last builtin driver without its own behavior test file
  (flagged as a known gap in 0.1.7). Covers `HomewizardP1Driver.get_data()`/`get_status()` (including
  single-phase/no-gas responses where optional fields are legitimately absent) and `discover()`'s
  network-scan orchestration (device found, none found, local-IP lookup failure). All response
  bodies are fabricated, matching the format used throughout this repo's other driver tests.
  `_probe_homewizard`'s own identity-extraction logic was already covered separately in
  `test_driver_discover_identity.py` and isn't duplicated here. Every `get_data()` success-path test
  also asserts `validate_contract_data(DeviceType.GRID_METER, data) == []`, so all four builtin
  drivers are now exercised against the runtime contract check added in 0.1.7.

## 0.1.7 — 2026-08-29

### Added
- New `energy_optimizer_drivers.contract_validation.validate_contract_data()` — checks a driver's
  returned dict against its `docs/contracts/{device_type}.md` data contract **at runtime**: every
  required field present and non-None, no unexpected keys, and correct types throughout. Until now,
  the required/optional split in `base.py`'s `GridMeterData`/`PVInverterData`/`EVChargerData`/
  `ACUnitData` TypedDicts was comment-only — Python erases `TypedDict` at runtime, so nothing
  actually checked a driver's real output against it, and this repo doesn't run a static type
  checker in CI either. This only covers the generic, mechanically-checkable part of each contract
  (structure and type) — semantic rules like "single-phase meters must report L2/L3 as `None`, not
  `0.0`" still need device-specific judgment and stay policy-only, same as `SECURITY.md` §1.4.
- `base.py`'s data TypedDicts now mark each required field with `Required[...]` instead of a
  comment, so the distinction is introspectable at runtime (`__required_keys__`) — what
  `validate_contract_data()` reads. Not a breaking change: the field set and types are unchanged.
- Wired the new check into the existing mocked `get_data()` tests for the three drivers that have
  behavior test suites (`test_daikin_brp.py`, `test_alfen_driver.py`, `test_aurora_driver.py`).
  `homewizard_p1` has no dedicated behavior test file yet — a pre-existing gap, not introduced or
  closed by this change — so it isn't covered by this check either, for now.
- `docs/contracts/*.md` each cross-reference `validate_contract_data()` under their required/optional
  field tables, so the doc and the code enforcing it point at each other.

## 0.1.6 — 2026-08-29

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` has been purged entirely from git history, not just untracked going forward (as of
  0.1.5). It contained no secrets or private data — this was done purely so the repo's history
  doesn't carry a file that's no longer part of the public repo, not a security response. **Every
  commit and tag in this repo was rewritten as a result** — if you cloned this repo before this
  release, discard that clone and re-clone; the old history is no longer compatible with what's on
  the remote.

## 0.1.5 — 2026-08-29

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` (AI-assisted development working notes) is no longer tracked in git — added to
  `.gitignore`. Its content was purely internal process notes (versioning reminders, cross-repo
  coordination rules) that consistently pointed to `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`SECURITY.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md`
  rather than duplicating them, so contributors lose nothing by it not being in the repo.
  `.github/agents/driver-reviewer.agent.md` is unaffected and remains tracked as-is — it's an active
  part of the documented PR review process (see `SECURITY.md`'s "Enforcement"), not internal-only
  notes, and removing it would actually remove a piece of process this repo's own docs describe.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "What this repo deliberately does not do" no longer points to `CLAUDE.md` for
  the no-deployment note, since that file is no longer visible to contributors — the point is stated
  inline instead.

## 0.1.4 — 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- `SECURITY.md`'s "Enforcement" section overstated what's actually automated. The
  `driver-reviewer.agent.md` checklist is **not** wired into CI or any GitHub Actions workflow —
  it only applies when a human or AI assistant is deliberately asked to use it, despite previously
  being described as "the automated driver reviewer agent." Corrected to clearly separate what
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` actually runs on every push/PR (ruff + the two pytest compliance
  suites) from what requires someone to actively invoke it. Also explicitly annotated the new §1.4
  rule (no real device data) as policy-only — it's not just currently uncovered by automation, it
  fundamentally cannot be: no static check can distinguish a fabricated hex string from a real one.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-08-29

### Added
- New zero-tolerance rule, `SECURITY.md` §1.4: no real device data (serial numbers, MAC addresses,
  device/room names, deployment IPs) may ever be committed anywhere in this repo, including test
  fixtures — fabricated data shaped to match the protocol only. This is a correctness rule as much
  as a privacy one: a driver written against one real device's actual responses tends to quietly
  assume that unit's specific firmware/region/config, which then doesn't generalize to the rest of
  the device family it's supposed to support. Cross-referenced from `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s testing
  section and checklist, `CLAUDE.md`, and the driver-reviewer agent's zero-tolerance list.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-08-29

### Security
- **Removed real device data (a device serial number, a device MAC address, and a real room name)
  that had been accidentally committed in a test fixture, mislabeled as "real payloads captured
  live" — replaced with clearly fabricated example data.** If you cloned this repo before this
  release, that data is present in your local copy's history; please discard that clone.

### Changed
- Full documentation pass for public readability: removed several references to internal-only
  tracking codes and non-public documents that a reader outside the project has no way to resolve,
  clarified collaborator-facing phrasing into plain documentation, and fixed a number of file paths
  left over from the original extraction that pointed at a directory structure this repo doesn't
  actually have.
- Added an explicit, consolidated list of changes that require maintainer coordination before a PR
  will be considered (new device types, ABC signature changes, contract constants, the entry-point
  group name) — previously only "you can't add a device type" was stated, with no explanation of why
  or what to do instead. See `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Changes that need a maintainer, not just a PR".

## 0.1.1 — 2026-08-29

### Added
- Per-driver behavior test suites moved over from `energy-optimizer`'s `tests/`
  (`test_alfen_driver.py`, `test_aurora_driver.py`, `test_daikin_brp.py`,
  `test_driver_discover_identity.py`) — these test driver internals directly and belong here now,
  not in the app repo testing code that no longer lives there.

### Fixed
- Added missing `__init__.py` to each device-type subpackage (`grid/`, `pv/`, `ev/`, `ac/`) and to
  `tests/` — present in the original `drivers/` tree but missed in the initial 0.1.0 extraction.
  Imports worked anyway via Python's implicit namespace packages, but this matches the original
  structure exactly rather than relying on that.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-29

### Added
- Initial extraction from `energy-optimizer`'s `drivers/` directory into this standalone,
  pip-installable package — no driver logic changed, only the import path (`drivers.*` →
  `energy_optimizer_drivers.*`) and packaging.
- Four builtin drivers: `homewizard_p1` (grid meter), `aurora_rs485` (PV inverter, RS-485), `alfen_eve`
  (EV charger), `daikin_brp` (AC unit).
- CI runs `test_contract_compliance.py` + `test_security_compliance.py` on every push/PR.
