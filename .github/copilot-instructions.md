# Copilot instructions — ionemo-drivers

Driver review checklist for this repository — for Copilot Chat and other AI assistants working
here, and for a maintainer reading a pull request by hand.

Copilot's own *pull request review* does not run on this repository: it needs a paid Copilot plan
this account does not have, so nothing applies this file automatically. Someone has to invoke it.

This repository is public and accepts driver contributions from anyone, so a driver lands on a
stranger's home network and talks to their hardware. Review accordingly: flag **every** violation
of the contracts and security rules below, no matter how minor, and say plainly when you find
none rather than inventing something.

Note what already runs without you: `tests/test_contract_compliance.py` and
`tests/test_security_compliance.py` enforce the structural and static-analysis items mechanically
on every PR. The most useful thing you can add is the judgement they cannot — whether
`discover()`/`get_data()` genuinely never raise on any path, whether a warning would actually help
a non-technical person, whether the data returned matches what the contract doc *means* rather
than merely its shape.

Your review is advisory. It informs a maintainer; it does not gate a merge.

You review drivers in the `ionemo_drivers/` directory against three sources of truth:

1. **`docs/contracts/{device_type}.md`** — Data contract, discovery contract, timeout rules
2. **`SECURITY.md`** — Security rules, data safety, network restrictions (note its "Note on
   automated enforcement" section — some rules are automated via `test_security_compliance.py`,
   others are policy-only and only caught by this review)
3. **`ionemo_drivers/base.py`** — ABC interfaces, type contracts, method signatures

**Produce a structured compliance report. Do not modify code.**

## Review Checklist

For every driver file you review, check ALL of the following:

### Identity & Structure

- [ ] Has `driver_id`, `name`, `manufacturer`, `device_type`, `connection_type` class attributes
- [ ] Subclasses the correct device-type ABC (`GridMeterDriver`, `PVInverterDriver`, `EVChargerDriver`, `ACUnitDriver`)
- [ ] `__init__(self, config: dict)` accepts config dict
- [ ] Registered via `register_driver()` at module level

### Config Schema

- [ ] `config_schema()` returns `list[ConfigField]`
- [ ] All fields have `key`, `label`, `type`, `required`
- [ ] `type` is one of: `text`, `password`, `number`, `select`
- [ ] Select fields have `options` list
- [ ] Credential fields use `type: "password"`
- [ ] At least one required field exists

### Discovery Contract

- [ ] `discover()` returns `DiscoveryResult` (not `list`)
- [ ] Never raises exceptions — all errors converted to warnings
- [ ] Warnings are user-facing, concise, non-technical, actionable
- [ ] Does not block indefinitely — LAN-based drivers using `scan_subnet()` inherit its own
      documented ceiling (currently 60s); a driver with its own scan loop applies a similarly
      bounded timeout. Don't flag a PR for a specific number here — check it references a real
      bound, not the literal "30 seconds" this checklist used to say before `scan_subnet()`'s own
      ceiling changed (twice) without every doc catching up. That drift is exactly why this note
      exists.
- [ ] If it overrides `discover_quick()`, confirm it forwards `quick=True` into `scan_subnet()`
      correctly (not just duplicating `discover()`'s body) — optional, not required
- [ ] Returned config dicts match `config_schema()` keys

### Data Contract

- [ ] `get_data()` returns the correct TypedDict or `None`
- [ ] All required fields are always present when returning data
- [ ] Never raises exceptions — catches all errors internally
- [ ] Returns `None` on communication failure (never raises)
- [ ] Respects timeout ≤ 15 seconds

### Status & Error

- [ ] `get_status()` is non-blocking (returns cached state, no I/O)
- [ ] `last_error` is a `@property` returning `str | None`
- [ ] Status values are from: `connected`, `error`, `sleeping`, `disabled`

### EV Charger Specific

- [ ] `set_current(amps: float) → bool` exists
- [ ] Clamps values above hardware max
- [ ] Returns `False` on failure (never raises)
- [ ] Has its own timeout (≤ 10 seconds)

### AC Unit Specific

- [ ] Three setters exist, not one: `set_mode(mode: str) → bool`, `set_temperature(temp_c: float) → bool`, `set_fan_speed(speed: str) → bool`
- [ ] `mode` values match the six defined in `docs/contracts/ac_unit.md` (`off`/`cool`/`heat`/`fan`/`dry`/`auto`)
- [ ] `fan_speed` values are driver-specific (deliberately not a fixed cross-brand enum — see the contract doc's "Fan Speed Values" section) but round-trip: a value returned by `get_data()` must be accepted by `set_fan_speed()`
- [ ] All three setters return `False` on failure or unrecognized input (never raise)
- [ ] `power_w` is `>= 0.0`; if the device can't report real-time power, `0.0` is acceptable (document it), not `None`

## Security Audit Checklist

**These are critical — flag with severity HIGH or CRITICAL:**

### Data Exfiltration (CRITICAL)

- [ ] No outbound internet connections (only LAN-local device communication)
- [ ] No analytics, telemetry, tracking, beacons
- [ ] No sending data to external APIs/servers
- [ ] No DNS requests to non-local domains (except for route detection in `discover()`)

### Credential Safety (HIGH)

- [ ] Credentials never logged at ANY level (scan all `logger.*` calls)
- [ ] Credentials not in URL query strings
- [ ] Credentials accepted only via `config` dict
- [ ] Password fields marked `type: "password"` in schema
- [ ] Credentials aren't retained/reused beyond what a persistent session needs — a driver keeping
      a long-lived authenticated session across polls (e.g. `alfen_eve.py`) is fine as long as it
      re-authenticates on failure rather than caching credentials somewhere new; flag a driver only
      if it does something beyond that (e.g. writes the session/credential to disk)

### Forbidden Operations (CRITICAL)

- [ ] No `eval()`, `exec()`, `compile()`
- [ ] No `pickle`, `marshal`, `yaml.load()` (unsafe loader)
- [ ] No `subprocess`, `os.system()`, `os.popen()`
- [ ] No `ctypes` (unless justified for serial)
- [ ] No raw `socket` usage outside of `discover()`

### Filesystem Safety (HIGH)

- [ ] No file reads outside driver directory (except CA cert path from config)
- [ ] No file writes, **except** through `ionemo_drivers.cert_store.resolve_verify()` for TOFU certificate
      pinning — this is the one documented exception (`SECURITY.md` §3.2); a driver writing
      files any other way is still a violation
- [ ] No temp file creation
- [ ] No database access

### Network Safety (HIGH)

- [ ] All HTTP/network calls have explicit timeout parameter
- [ ] HTTPS drivers with self-signed certs use `ionemo_drivers.cert_store.resolve_verify()` (TOFU pinning)
      rather than disabling verification or implementing their own pinning/monkey-patching
- [ ] No listening sockets / server creation
- [ ] No connections to cloud services

### Code Safety (MEDIUM)

- [ ] No `print()` statements (use `logging` module)
- [ ] No monkey-patching of globals/other modules
- [ ] No signal handler modifications
- [ ] No long-lived background threads
- [ ] No vendored binaries or native extensions

### Privacy (MEDIUM)

- [ ] No serial numbers or MAC addresses logged above DEBUG
- [ ] No PII in logs at INFO level or above
- [ ] No energy consumption data logged at INFO level or above

## How to Review

### When asked to review a specific driver:

1. Read the driver file completely
2. Read the relevant `docs/contracts/{device_type}.md` contract
3. Read `SECURITY.md` for security rules
4. Go through EVERY checklist item systematically
5. Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v` to verify automated checks pass (both contract and
   security compliance suites — note these are structural/AST checks, not behavioral tests; they
   won't catch a "never raises" violation, so don't treat a pass as a substitute for reading the code)
6. Produce the compliance report

### When asked to review all drivers:

1. List all driver files: `ionemo_drivers/grid/*.py`, `ionemo_drivers/pv/*.py`, `ionemo_drivers/ev/*.py`, `ionemo_drivers/ac/*.py`,
   plus root-level infra files (`base.py`, `registry.py`, `cert_store.py`) which the automated
   security suite also scans
2. Review each driver individually
3. Produce a consolidated report

## Zero Tolerance

The following findings result in **immediate REJECTED status** regardless of everything else:

1. Any outbound internet connection not required by the device protocol
2. Any form of `eval()`, `exec()`, or dynamic code execution
3. Any credential logging at any level
4. Any `subprocess` or process spawning
5. Any file system writes
6. Any `pickle`/`marshal` deserialization
7. Any evidence of intentional data collection beyond the device contract
8. **Any real device data committed anywhere in the PR** — a real serial number, MAC address,
   device ID, hostname, device/room name, or an IP address that looks like it came from an actual
   deployment rather than a documentation range (`192.168.1.x`/`192.0.2.x`), in test fixtures,
   docstrings, comments, or docs. See `SECURITY.md` §1.4 — check test fixtures and example
   responses specifically, not just the driver logic itself.

**When in doubt, flag it.** False positives are acceptable. False negatives are not.
